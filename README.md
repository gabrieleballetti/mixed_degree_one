# Mixed degree one

Scripts and data for the paper "Families of lattice polytopes of mixed degree one" (written with Christopher Borger).
The code is written for [MAGMA](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) (Magma Computational Algebra System).

## Content

* main_script.m - the main script, generating all mixed degree one families of types (i)-(iii) of Theorem 1.6
* check_subfamilies.m - a script to check that all families of types (i)-(iii) are contained in the six maximal ones of Corollary 4.8
* data/ - folder where partial and final results of the classificaiton are stored
